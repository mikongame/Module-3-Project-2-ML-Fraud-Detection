# Module 3 Project 2 (ML) Fraud-Detection

## Context

This dataset contains around 18K job descriptions out of which about 900 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent.

## Inspiration
The dataset is very valuable as it can be used to answer the following questions:

- Create a classification model that uses text data features and meta-features and predict which job description are fraudulent or real.
- Identify key traits/features (words, entities, phrases) of job descriptions which are fraudulent in nature.
- Run a contextual embedding model to identify the most similar job descriptions.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to identify interesting insights from this dataset.
